To quick-start the project:
create a virtual environment, call it '.env' and install the requirements.
run these three scripts:
reset_db.sh - this creates the sqlite database and table
run_app.sh - this runs the flaskr.py file in the background
insert_data.sh - this inserts three sample orders
View the orders in the browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/orders/
